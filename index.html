                            This involved brainstorming ideas with the team, laying out the platform's core objectives, and identifying features 
                            that would increase user engagement. My proposed features included an interactive map for food truck locations, a 
                            calendar for upcoming events, and a booking system for private events.

                    which initially seemed like a good solution. However, when one team member didn't respond, it became clear that indecision could stall our progress. 
                    Taking initiative, I implemented a random name picker and communicated a deadline to the team. Reflecting on this, I realized how important it is to 
                    step up and guide the team through indecisive moments. It taught me the value of decisiveness and clear communication when moving the group forward."

                <div class="timeline-milestone" data-title="Key Contributions"
                    data-description="One of the most significant contributions I made was reworking our project design after receiving feedback that our initial focus on user-generated 
                    data wasn’t aligned with the course objectives. I reviewed the relevant datasets, which allowed me to redefine the features to meet the course expectations. 
                    It was also my responsibility to assign tasks (See Image 15) to the team based on their skills and workload. I realized how crucial it is to strike a balance between workload and team preferences to maintain motivation.
                    During our first presentation, we encountered an issue where the last team member did not have enough time to finish her prepared content. 
                    As the team leader, I felt responsible for this oversight, recognizing that I could have rehearsed more with the team to ensure better time management. 
                    This experience motivated me to take a different approach for our second presentation. I worked closely with the team to fine-tune our preparation, making sure we allocated time more effectively and rehearsed together to ensure a smooth delivery.
                    As a result, our second presentation was much more organized, and every team member had the opportunity to fully showcase their contributions. Reflecting on this experience, I see how delegation, clear task distribution, 
                    and proactive planning can foster both individual and collective success, leading our team to achieve a great result."

                    data-description="Taking on a leadership role throughout the project was a rewarding challenge. From the start, I led the team through difficult phases such as 
                    adapting to feedback and refining our project. I arranged meetings to clarify expectations and maintain a consistent workflow (See Image 16). During the MVP and proposal presentations,
                    I managed the time effectively, ensuring everyone could contribute equally. Reflecting on these moments, I learned that leadership isn’t just about directing others 
                    but about fostering an environment where every team member can thrive and feel empowered to share their ideas."

                    data-description="Reflecting on this project, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of the importance of structured communication and effective planning. While there were challenges and moments 
                    of uncertainty, they were outweighed by the times when our team collaborated seamlessly. Throughout this experience, I’ve grown both as a developer and as a leader, particularly in how I handle 
                    feedback and ensure the project stays aligned with its goals. Above all, I’ve learned that leadership demands adaptability and the ability to make tough decisions, all while fostering an environment where each team member feels valued and supported. 
                    I’m especially grateful for the dedication and contributions of my team members (See Image 17)."
