                            During this phase, we conducted brainstorming sessions to generate ideas, sketch rough wireframes, 
                            and outline the core objectives of the platform. We explored various features that could enhance user engagement, 
                            including an interactive map for discovering food trucks, a calendar for upcoming events, and booking options for private events.

                            which provides real-time information on food truck locations across the city. This project helped solidify the idea of integrating 
                            real-time data and interactive map features to improve user engagement.

                            making a few key design changes. These adjustments helped refine the final prototype to better reflect our MVP features and enhance user experience.

                        <p>Additionally, I developed the backend in PHP to fetch data from the Food Truck and Market APIs, and I built the index page and details page. 
                            These pages display dynamic content pulled from the APIs, providing real-time information on food truck locations and events.

                    Despite efforts to involve the team, no one volunteered for the role. This led me to create a poll (See Image 10) for members to vote, 
                    which initially seemed like a good solution. However, when one team member didn't respond, it became clear that indecision could stall our progress. 
                    Taking initiative, I implemented a random name picker and communicated a deadline to the team. Reflecting on this, I realized how important it is to 
                    step up and guide the team through indecisive moments. It taught me the value of decisiveness and clear communication when moving the group forward."

                    It was also my responsibility to assign tasks to the team based on their skills and workload (See Image 11). I realized how crucial it is to strike a balance between 
                    workload and team preferences to maintain motivation. Our MVP presentation reflected this balance, as I ensured each member had enough time to showcase their work. 
                    Reflecting on this, I see how delegation and clear task distribution can foster both individual and collective success."

                    I managed the time effectively, ensuring everyone could contribute equally. Reflecting on these moments, I learned that leadership isn’t just about directing others
